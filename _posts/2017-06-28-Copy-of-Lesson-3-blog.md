    <td>I learned by looking at how I could complete my task on the internet. Before doing this I consulted peers who had achieved what I was looking to achieved. I refrained from menial chatting with my neighbours, this meant that I could achieve bigger and better things.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning was an initial giving up on the game, leading to me stopping working to my potential. This limited my learning as I wasted time in menial conversation with my adjacent peers, this is a definite habite a must work on to better my learning.</td>
